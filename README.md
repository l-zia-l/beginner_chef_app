# 🍽 Meal Ordering Simulation - Procedural Programming Style

Hi! I'm ZiA and this is one of my very first Python projects. This little script was created to help me **get comfortable with Python** and explore the **procedural programming paradigm** — where you tell the computer **exactly what to do, one step at a time**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The program simulates a simple food ordering and meal preparation process. You pick a meal from a list, and then the program walks through the steps of preparing and serving it — all written in a straightforward, top-to-bottom procedural style.

### 🧠 Why I Made This

As a beginner, I wanted to:

- Practice using functions and user input in Python
- Understand how **procedural programming** works by doing
- Create something fun and familiar (who doesn't love food?!)
- Lay the foundation to later **refactor this code using Object-Oriented and Functional Programming paradigms** (coming soon!)

## 🧪 How It Works

- The user chooses a meal from a menu
- The program responds with the meal selected
- Then it walks through the cooking process using defined procedures (functions)

### 🧾 Example Output
Hello! What would you like to order today?

Fried Rice & Roasted Chicken

Jollof Rice & Fried Fish

Groundnut Soup & Rice Balls

Fufu w/ Light Soup & Beef

Enjoy your jollof rice and fried fish
Order up!!
Chopping onions, washing utensils, heating up oil
Here you go!

## 📚 Concepts Practiced

- Basic Python syntax
- Input/output
- Functions (procedures)
- Control flow with `if`/`elif`/`else`

## 🔮 What’s Next

- [ ] Rewrite this using **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP)
- [ ] Create a version using **Functional Programming**
- [ ] Make the menu more interactive with a loop
- [ ] Add error handling and extra polish

## 📜 Disclaimer

This project is **for learning purposes** and is part of my coding journey. It’s beginner-level and intentionally kept simple so I can build up my understanding and refactor later. Feel free to fork or suggest ideas!
